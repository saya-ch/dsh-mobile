# Changelog

Notable changes to DSH Mobile are recorded here. GitHub Releases remain the source for downloadable packages and complete generated commit notes.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-08-27

- Detect LAN and remote pairing links automatically after a QR scan, independent of the currently selected connection page.
- Clarify QR, network, firewall, certificate, and pairing failures so users can identify the shortest recovery path.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-08-25

- Add a stable Android app download entry to the desktop Mobile Access panel.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-24

- Add independent LAN and remote access flows with separate paired-device stores.
- Add optional Tailscale Funnel and managed cpolar remote providers.
- Restore saved Android connections automatically and improve mobile loading over limited links.
- Page older session history on demand and compress eligible gateway responses.
- Build the pinned Funnel host from source and publish checksums, an SBOM, and third-party notices.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-08-23

- Keep the plugin compatible with DeepSeek Harness 0.1.1.
- Continue mobile layout, safe-area, composer, settings, and interaction improvements.
- Restore bounded native response reads on Android 10 through 12.
- Publish Android releases as reproducible, signed release builds instead of temporary debug builds.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-08-23
